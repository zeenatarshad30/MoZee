### **Memory: My 22nd Birthday 🎂🥳**
- **Date:** 30/11/2023
- **Location:** Sarita Udhyan, Gandhinagar & Fortune Park, Ahmedabad 

Moin, I can't help but go back to those few days before my birthday. You had come to Baroda, and a part of me was really hoping you’d stay a little longer—my birthday was just around the corner. But I understood when you had to head back to Pune for the important meeting. I knew work had to come first, and I told myself it was okay... even if it wasn’t 😕. 

Then, one night, out of nowhere, you asked me, “ *Can I ask you something?Please don’t be angry.*" I was confused but curious, and you went on to ask, *“Zeenat, will you go on a date with me on your birthday? 🌹🙈*” I couldn't believe it. My heart was pounding ❤️‍🔥, and my cheeks were burning 🙈—I just couldn't stop smiling 🫠. You were coming all the way back, from Pune to Ahmedabad, just for me 🥹. I think I blushed for the rest of that night. How could I possibly say no 😌🤭🙈?

When our fourth date finally came, I was so nervous and excited. You arrived in Ahmedabad that afternoon, and sent delicious lunch—something your mom had made specially for me 🥹. Biryani, karachi rolls, halwa, dahi... it was all so delicious 🤤. I felt like the luckiest girl in the world, already blessed with the most wonderful mother-in-law 💯🥹.

I got ready after lunch, and when you came to pick me up, I couldn't believe how handsome you looked 🫠🙈😍. You were wearing a white shirt with stripes of yellow, blue, and pink... and those glasses—I’d never seen you wear them before 🫠. I couldn’t take my eyes off you, and when you saw me, you blushed and wished me a happy birthday 🎂. When you complimented that I was looking hot 🥵 in my maroon co-ord set, I couldn't stop blushing 🫠🙈🙈.

We drove to the same place as our first date, and even though it was dark, I wasn’t afraid at all. You were right there beside me. I felt safe. We walked around the garden and then sat on that little bench. We talked about how our family is planning on selecting a wedding date 🙈. Moin, Do you remember how we both agreed that 24th December 2024..this date sounds perfect. And then, you just stopped, looked me right in the eyes, and asked,*"Zeenat Puthawala, will you marry me? 🙈🫠🫠”* My face went hot, and my heart felt like it was about to burst. I said yes, of course... how could I not ❤️‍🔥🙈🫠?

On our way back to the car, you suddenly pulled me over. I was so confused, but then you wrapped your arms around me 🙈, and I melted into your chest 🫠. I could feel your heartbeat, and I swear, in that moment, nothing else in the world mattered ❤️‍🔥. I had to stand on my tiptoes to reach you, and you held me so tightly around my waist. Caressing my hair with one hand.. It was the perfect hug—the one I’d always dreamt about 🫠🙈. You kissed my forehead, my cheeks... I blushed, and I think you did too. I’ve never felt so close to someone in my life 🙈🙈❤️‍🔥.

Back in the car, you surprised me with awesome gifts, and we headed to the most romantic candlelight dinner 🙈. I’ll never forget how handsome you looked in that soft glow 😍. I couldn’t stop thinking about that hug, and I could tell you were thinking about it too—you kept glancing at me, smiling, blushing. The dinner was perfect—soup, seekh, chicken tikka, and your favorite mutton biryani 🤤. On our way home, *“Abhi na jaao chod kar, ke dil abhi bhara nahi 🩷🥹”* played on the radio, and I just knew we were feeling the same thing 🙈. 

Moin, my parents have always made my birthdays special 🥹, but this one... this birthday was different. You made it the best birthday of my life, filled with so much love, warmth, and happiness 💋. I can’t thank Allah enough for bringing you into my life. Alhamdulillah 🥹.. I love you more than words can say ❤️‍🔥.
