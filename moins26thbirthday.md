Moin, I wanted to make your 26th birthday as special as you are to me 🌹, something that would genuinely take you by surprise 🙈. After all, my man deserves nothing but the best 💯💋. So, I decided to celebrate in Baroda, to make it a day you wouldn’t forget. A day before, I tried to be quirky and playful, teasing you with: "*Please don't get jealous, but I'm in love with a guy, and it's his birthday tomorrow. I'm planning to surprise him by showing up in his hometown, but I have no idea about bus routes. Could you help me out as a friend? 😌🙈*" Your response was everything I hoped for—I couldn’t see your face, but I just knew you were blushing and smiling like a little kid 💋.

The morning started with me boarding the bus 🚌, facing a fear I've had for as long as I can remember. Buses have always made me anxious, filling my mind with wild thoughts about being lost or taken to some far-off unknown place 🤭(stupid phobia - right?😌). But I knew I had to conquer that fear—for you 😘, for us 🙈. The bus ride was a mix of nervousness and excitement, especially when a random uncle sat beside me 😬, making my anxiety spike 📈. But you were there, checking in on me the whole way, making sure I felt safe 🥹💋.

The moment I arrived and saw you waiting outside the bus, my worries vanished. There you were, my handsome birthday boy, in that white tee and blue jeans—a perfect reminder of how incredibly lucky I am to have you 🙈🙈. 

We went to Tulip Touch Cafe, and I loved the cozy, creative vibe 😍. The 2D doodles all around, the fun atmosphere—it was the perfect place 💯😍. We shared a delicious chocolate croissant 🥐😋, chocolate milkshake 🥤, and watermelon mojito 🍉, and honestly, everything was yumm just like you 😉. Then we headed to BounceUp 😍, and I can't stop smiling when I think about it 🤭. The trampolines, the bouncy castle, the slides—just bouncing around like carefree kids was pure joy. I haven't laughed like that in ages 🙈.

Back at your home, Mehreen led me to your room 😌 (she's always soo sweet arranging our meet-ups, such a sweet heart😘), and we got a little precious alone time together 🫠🙈. The hugs 🫠🤗🤗 hayyyyyy🫦, the kisses😘😘😘😘😘😘🙈🙈🙈, the playful bites🫦🫦... gosh, I'm blushing and melting just writing this!🙈🫠 And the handmade card—do you remember? It took me a whole month to complete 👩🏻‍🎨, pouring my heart into every detail. But seeing the way you blushed when you opened it and appreciating each and every part made every second of effort worth it 💯💋. You thanked me for making your birthday special, for overcoming my fear of buses just to be with you. I remember laughing, blushing and showing you the tiny gap between my index finger and thumb , saying my fear of buses 🚌 was "this much 🤏🏻," but my love ❤️‍🔥 for you was "this much🫲🏻   🫱🏻," stretching my arms as wide as they could go 😌🙈. If only my arms could stretch further because, Moin, my love for you is beyond measure—beyond infinity ♾️🙈💯💋.

You patiently explained your work to me 🙈, answering my every question with such sincerity 😘. I couldn’t help but blush, thinking how lucky I am to have such a wonderful teacher by my side—my incredibly handsome, sexy, hot teacher 🫦👨🏻‍🏫🥵🔥. 

And dinner—oh, your mom outdid herself as always 👩🏻‍🍳! Biryani and starters that could rival any chef’s, and I just kept feeling grateful 🫠. Moms truly have some special magic, don’t they? Every bite was amazing, and sharing that meal with both of our families made it feel like such a blessed moment 💯—Alhamdulillah 🙈.

But then, the night had to end 🥹. Saying goodbye was the hardest part. I didn’t want to leave—I just wanted to stay with you, to hold onto that day forever. But then I reminded myself that, Insha'Allah, just eight months from now, we'll be together, and that thought made my heart race with anticipation ❤️‍🔥. Look today, a few days now and I'll be yours forever.. Insha'allah 🫠🫠🥹.
