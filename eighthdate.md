### **Memory: Eighth Date ❤️‍🔥**  
- **Date:** 23/06/2024  
- **Location:** Fozzie's Pizzaiolo,Symphony Forest Park,Ahmedabad

Moin, This date holds a special place in my heart, because it was our last before everything changes 🥹... in the best way possible. We were meeting after such a long time, and the anticipation made it even sweeter. When you came to pick me up at 2 in the afternoon, I couldn’t take my eyes off you 🫠. You looked so handsome in that light blue tee with white stripes and your fresh haircut—it felt like you were a sight straight out of my dreams 😘🫠🙈. And the way you noticed me in my brown shirt and immediately said I looked hot 😌🙈... I could feel my cheeks turning red with every word you spoke ❤️‍🔥🙈. 

Our first stop was Fozzie’s Pizzaiolo for pizza 🍕—it was simple, delicious, and perfect, just like you 🤤🙈. But my favorite part of the date was our long walk in Symphony Forest Park 🙈. It was just the two of us, surrounded by nature 🌳, sharing little moments that felt like they could last forever ♾️. The way you held my hand 👩🏻‍🤝‍👨🏻, the sunlight filtering through the trees 🌥️, the cool breeze 🍃—everything was just right 🫠🙈.

At one point, I worried about you being late and suggested we part ways. But you wanted to stay longer, and I couldn’t have been happier when you said that 🥹. So, we headed to Palladium Mall, hoping to bowl, but the game zone was closed 😕. It didn’t matter, though—wondering around with you was more than enough. Sharing that warm cup of tea together 😋. It’s the simple moments like these with you that I’ll always treasure, the kind that make me smile even now 🫠🙈.

When you surprised me with the little blue penguin 🐧, its eyes closed in the cutest way 😍, I couldn’t help but giggle 🤭🙈. It sits on my desk now, reminding me of our date and how much I love you 💋. 

When you dropped me home, I asked you inside to show you my work projects 💻—honestly, it was just an excuse to steal a little more time with you 🥹. The moments we spent in Dadi Ammi’s room were so private and precious, and as I write this, I can’t help but blush 🫠🙈. I wish you were here right now so I could hug you tight like we did that day 🫠🙈🙈.

This was our last date before the wedding 🥹, and now it’ll be exactly 189 days until we see each other again on our big day, Insha'allah 🫠🙈. I miss you more than words can say, Moin 🥹. I'm so excited about all that’s ahead of us—romantic dinners 🍽️👩🏻‍❤️‍👨🏻, lazy Sunday mornings wrapped up in blankets, hayyy 🫠🤗🤗🤗, cozy movie nights 😉🎥🍿🌃, wandering through places we've never explored before 👩🏻‍🤝‍👨🏻, late-night talks that stretch into the sunrise 🌄, morning coffee runs ☕😋, shared breakfasts 🍳🥞, and the adventures that lie in wait for us 🙈🫠. I can’t wait for more of those sleepy mornings when I’ll wake up next to you 🙈💋🫠💤, for those spontaneous adventures we’ll take just because we can 🧗🏻‍♀️, for the moments when you’ll make me laugh until my cheeks hurt 🙈, and for all the times you’ll make me blush with just a look 🫠.

But even more than that, I can’t wait to start a family with you 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🫶. I imagine us navigating the wonderful chaos of raising our kids together—our little munchkins running around, filling our home with laughter and joy 🍼👶🏻. I dream of the day we’ll be watching them take their first steps 👣, hear them say their first words 🥹, and guide them through their first day of school 📚✏️. We'll be there to cheer them on 🥳, help with their homework, and teach them all the lessons that matter 🤗. I know you’ll be the best dad 🥹💯🙈, with your patience and your kindness 🙈😘💋.

I’m looking forward to family outings where we'll pack everyone into the car 🚗 and set out on spontaneous adventures 🌳🏞️, those afternoons where we'll all sit together for a big, noisy family lunch, filled with stories and laughter 🍝🍲. I can’t wait for us to explore the world together as a family—whether it’s a road trip 🛣️ to a nearby town or a journey to places we've only dreamed of 🌍✈️. And as our kids grow, I hope they look at us as the parents they admire, the ones who stayed united through everything. I want to build a life with you that will be an example for them and for everyone around us 💯🥹—a life filled with love ❤️, trust, and a partnership that never wavers. Insha'allah 🙈..

And in all this, I know our bond will only grow deeper 💯, not just in the big moments, but in the quiet ones too. I can't wait to pray Fazr together 🤲🏻. And those peaceful late nights 🌃, when the world is asleep and we wake up for Tahajjud, seeking Allah's blessings together, side by side 🥹🤗.

I dream of growing old with you, of us sharing quiet moments in our home when our hair has turned grey, and our faces carry the lines of a life lived together, rich with memories 😍. Of us reminiscing about the early days, still laughing like we did when we first met, knowing that we’ve built a life, a family, and a love that truly stood the test of time 🥹💋. Insha'allah 🙈🥹..

I'm counting down the days until I can stand beside you, hand in hand, as your wife 😉👰🏻‍♀️—ready to face the world together, with all its joys and challenges. Insha'allah 💋..I can’t wait to create a lifetime of memories with you, my love 💋.

Love you Moin Bhavnagri
Always and beyond 💋♾️
