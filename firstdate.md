### **Memory: First Date ❤️‍🔥**  
- **Date:** 01/05/2023  
- **Location:** Sarita Udhyan,Gandhinagar 

Moin, I was so nervous 🙈❤️‍🔥, yet bursting with excitement on the day of our first date after we got engaged 🙈. I chose a green floral dress and left my hair open, but still felt unsure 🤔.

When you picked me up, I still remember you wearing that blue shirt with small white anchors 😍🫠. The moment you saw me, you told me I looked beautiful ❤️‍🔥🙈, and instantly, all the doubts I had about my dress melted away. I felt so confident and special, Moin, because you made me feel that way. It was one of those moments I’ll never forget 🙈.

When you asked me to connect my phone and play music, I was unsure if you’d like my choices, but you vibed with the songs so beautifully 😘. When "Perfect" by Ed Sheeran played, we both laughed and blushed 🙈, saying it was our favorite song. It was the start of a song that would forever be ours 💖.

We drove to Gandhinagar, planning to visit Indroda National Park, but it was closed. We didn’t mind and ended up stopping at a sugarcane juice stall. I remember the cool breeze, the sweetness of the juice, and the way we shared that simple moment together. It was a small, yet beautiful pause that made the day feel even more special. I couldn’t help but blush when I caught you looking at me while we sipped the juice 😌😏🙈.

Then, we visited Sarita Udhyan, and I can’t forget those long walks with you 🫠. Remember how I was struggling in my black heels to climb that bridge 🤭😅? I am laughing thinking about it but you held my hand 🫠, and I blushed so hard, but it made me feel so cared for. We sat on a bench, talked about our likes, our dislikes, our lives, our childhood memories, and I’m still blushing just thinking about it 🙈🙈.

Riding swings together was so much fun! On our way back, we exchanged gifts, and your note—"Zeenat, You captured my heart the very first time we met ❤️‍🔥"—still melts my heart 🫠. I’ve never told you this before, but at that exact moment, I felt like the luckiest person in the world 💯❤️‍🔥.

We ended the day with lunch at Xerodegree café, enjoying fries 🍟 and waffles 😋, and I couldn’t stop smiling all day long 🙈. It was a day I’ll never forget, and I still smile every time I think about it 🫠🙈.
