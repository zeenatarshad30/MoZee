### **Memory: Sixth Date ❤️‍🔥**  
- **Date:** 09/03/2024  
- **Location:** Fun Blast, Ahmedabad 

Moin, Our sixth date was truly something special. It was just three days after our first anniversary 😍🙈, but since it was a weekday and we were both swamped with work, we couldn’t meet. So, when you asked me out on Saturday, it felt like a way to extend our celebration 🎉.

You said you'd pick me up at 3 in the afternoon, but you got so caught up in Ahmedabad gathering lighting and decorations for our room—getting everything ready for the wedding. When 7 PM rolled around and you finally arrived 🙃, I was disappointed 😕, thinking of how little time we had left 🥹. But the moment I saw you, all the frustration faded away 🙈. You apologized so cutely, and somehow, just seeing your face made everything okay 🙈💋.

You were wearing that black shirt I gifted you, and you looked so handsome as ever 🙈. When you complimented my mehndi green kurti, saying I looked hot and beautiful 🙈, it made all the effort to get ready for you worth it 🙈❤️‍🔥. I remember you mentioning the day before how much you love when I leave my hair open, so I did just that, and the fact that you noticed and complimented me made me blush even more🙈.

We headed to "Fun Blast" for a bit of adventure 😍, and I was secretly terrified 🤫. I never told you before how scared I am of rides 🎢. That first ride—the one with the two cabins swinging like a wild ferris wheel—looked so intense, and I almost backed out 😨. But then, you grabbed my hand, and in that moment, I felt like I could face anything 🙈💯. With you there, the fear just faded, and I ended up having so much fun 😍🙈.

The giant swing was the wildest part! We didn’t expect it to be so thrilling 😬🤯. It took us up so high that we were laughing about how tiny everything looked below, and then—bam—the swing dropped, and we both shouted "fuc*" at the exact same moment before bursting into laughter 🤭😂. Seeing you laugh like that made me fall in love with you all over again 💋. I never thought I could have this much fun with rides; they always terrified me as a kid, but you made them feel like an adventure I never want to end 🙈🙈.

After all that excitement, we grabbed some fries 🍟, garlic bread 🥖, and shared a steaming cup of kulhad chai 🍵. We only had three hours together, but they were three perfect hours 🙈💋. When it was time for you to leave, you looked so sad, saying you didn’t want to go, and honestly, I didn’t wanted you to go either 🥹. 

As I’m writing this, I realize we have just 32 days left until our big day 🫠. Insha'allah.. And I can’t help but blush thinking about how beautiful our life together is going to be. Insha'Allah 🫠💋🙈.
