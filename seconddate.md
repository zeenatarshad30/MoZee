### **Memory: Second Date ❤️‍🔥**  
- **Date:** 02/07/2023  
- **Location:** Aquatic Gallery, Science City, Ahmedabad 

It was our second date, and you picked me up right at noon. You had come all the way from Baroda, wearing that dark-bluish tee with the zipper and white collars—you looked incredibly handsome 🙈🫠😍, and my heart skipped a beat the moment I saw you ❤️‍🔥. I couldn’t help but ask, "Where are we going?" and you, with that charming smile of yours, simply said, “It’s a surprise 🙈.”

You took me to Science City, to the Aquatic Gallery, and I couldn’t believe it—you remembered how I once told you that watching fish brings a calmness to my soul. Knowing you planned the date around something so simple yet meaningful to me made my heart swell with joy 🙈💋.

As we got out of the car, you asked if you could put your arm around my shoulder 😌😇. The fact that you asked—always so gentle and respectful—made me realize once again what a gentleman you are 🙈😘. It’s in the little things you do, like holding doors open, opening the car door for me, and helping me with my things, that make me feel like the luckiest girl in the world. Every gesture shows me that chivalry isn’t dead; it’s alive and well in you 🙈.

I had so much fun at the Aquatic Gallery. I was mesmerized by the colorful fish 🐟, but I noticed you were watching me more than the tanks 😌😏🫠🙈, and it made my heart flutter 💗. We even explored the Robotic Gallery. Normally, history bores me to my core, but with you by my side, even the most ordinary topics felt extraordinary. You have this way of making everything sound fascinating, and I could listen to you talk about the things you love for hours 💯.  

We stopped at the Science City cafe, where we shared pizza 🍕, nuggets 😋, and coffee ☕. It was so simple, yet with you, it felt perfect ❤️.

On the way back to the car, you asked if you could hug me 🤗. My heart pounded because I had never hugged a guy before. But there, in your car, we shared our first hug 🫠. I was so nervous that I pulled away after just two seconds, but you didn’t mind. You gently asked for another, and this time, I let myself relax. I closed my eyes and leaned into you 🫠, and I’ve never felt so safe 🥹. Your freshly trimmed beard brushed against my cheeks, and I finally understood why I love you with your beard—it just feels right 😌🙈.

When the hug ended and we pulled back, you looked into my eyes and kissed my forehead 😘. Even now, I can still feel the warmth of that kiss, and it makes me blush just thinking about it 🙈.

That day, I knew—I was falling in love with you 🙈🫠.
