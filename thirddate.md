### **Memory: Third Date ❤️‍🔥**  
- **Date:** 30/09/2023  
- **Location:** Shott, Ahmedabad

Moin, this date was a true rollercoaster 🎢 of emotions for me, filled with unexpected moments that I’ll never forget.

You were supposed to reach by 2 PM, but your car broke down on the way 😔, delaying your arrival until 5 PM. Even then, you made it, refusing to cancel. I remember feeling so emotional that you still wanted to see me, even without your car 🥹. We ended up using Dad’s car instead of taking a cab because I wanted our date to feel right.

We headed to Shott. We started with go-karting 🏎️, and I remember how you outpaced me 😌😏, doing four extra laps and leaving me behind. Usually, I’m so competitive, and losing is not my thing—but seeing you smile made me so happy 😘🙈. Your smile was worth every loss. After that, we headed for bowling 🎳. Of course, you were a champion there too 😎, but you didn’t just play; you taught me 😘👨🏻‍🏫. You showed me how to roll the ball like I was a complete newbie 🤭, and the way you patiently explained things made me feel so special. It was one of those moments where I thought I could listen to you forever 🙈.

But then, reality interrupted—your car mechanic called, and we had to cut our date short to go pick up your car. I was disappointed that our time was ending, but something extraordinary happened that day 😌❤️‍🔥. 

As we reached the car, you called me to the back, saying you wanted to show me something inside. I was so nervous, thinking there was something strange in the car—maybe even a mouse 😕! But it was just your way of drawing me closer 😌😏. Suddenly, you pulled me into a hug 🤗, and my whole world stood still ❤️‍🔥. You held me so tightly, and I could feel my heart racing. Then, you kissed my forehead, and everything just melted away 🫠❤️‍🔥.

But that wasn’t all. You leaned in and whispered the words that I’d been waiting to hear: “I love you ❤️‍🔥.” My heart skipped a beat, and I couldn’t help but blush. I was too shy to respond then, so I ran to the car door to hide my face 🤭🙈. But later, after more talking and sharing little gifts, you reached out for my hand, our fingers interlocking perfectly 🫠. Then, you kissed the back of my hand and said “I love you” once more. This time, I found the courage to say it back—“I love you too 🙈🙈🫠.”

I’ll never forget how you looked, how you blushed when I said those words, and how happy you made me feel that day 🫠🙈. Alhamdulillah, I can't thank Allah enough for blessing me with you. 

Moin, you’re my answered prayer, and that day was a beautiful reminder of how much you mean to me 💋.
