**Here’s a glimpse of our first engagement anniversary 🙈. Even though we were miles apart 😞, we found a way to celebrate our big milestone by sending cakes to each other 🎂. It’s moments like these that remind me how special our love is—across any distance, we make it work 🥹. Alhamdulillah..More beautiful moments to come and many more anniversaries to celebrate, where we won’t need separate cakes, just one to share together 💯💕. Insha'Allah 🙈..**
