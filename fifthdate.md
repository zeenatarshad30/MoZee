### **Memory: Fifth Date ❤️‍🔥**  
- **Date:** 13/01/2024  
- **Location:** Palladium Mall, Ahmedabad 

You had come to town for a wedding, but somehow, in your busy schedule, you carved out a little morning just for me 😘. My phone screen was broken, so you called Zeba's phone to ask me on a date. You said you'd pick me up at 10 AM, and knowing you, I assumed it would be closer to 11 😌🤭.But to my surprise, you came early 🤯! I didn’t even get the chance to do my makeup or fix my hair properly 🙃—I just let it down, hoping it would look somewhat presentable. Flustered, I rushed downstairs, and there you were, waiting in the car with that smile that always makes my heart skip a beat 🙈❤️‍🔥.

I knocked on the window, and you stepped out immediately, opening the car door for me like the true gentleman you are 🙈. You wore the brown shirt with blue strips which I gifted you and you were looking extremely handsome and hot🙈😍. You looked at me and said, “You look beautiful in pink 🩷” and in that moment, I forgot all about my rushed look. You have this way of making me feel like the most beautiful person in the world, even when I feel far from it 🥹🙈.

First, we went to the Oppo showroom to get my screen fixed. While waiting for it, we decided to make the most of the day and headed to Palladium Mall for bowling 🎳. On the way, we stopped for chaat 😋 and then grabbed some froyo 🍧. We both made our own ice cream, but when I tasted mine, it was awful 🥴! I tried yours, and it was amazing, as expected 🤤. Without hesitation, you exchanged our cups—you gave me your perfect creation and took my disaster 🥹.That small, sweet gesture spoke volumes—it’s always the little things you do that make me fall for you even more 💋.

At the game zone, we had the best time bowling 🎳😍. Two rounds later, we moved to the AR zone and chose the dinosaur  adventure 🦖—it felt so real, we were laughing and screaming like kids 🤭. Then we played air hockey 🏒, where I tried so hard to win but couldn’t stop giggling at how competitive we both were 🤭😂.

Eventually, it was time to leave. We collected my phone, and as we were driving back, your mom called, reminding you about the wedding you were running late for. I felt bad and suggested a shortcut, but it turned out to be blocked, making us wait even longer 🥹. I thought you’d be upset, and it made me sad, but you didn’t say a word—no blame, no frustration 🥹💋. You just smiled at me, as soft and understanding as ever 🥹🤗.

It’s these little moments, Moin. The way you’re patient with me 🥹, the way you always make me feel cherished 🩷, the way you go out of your way to bring a smile to my face 🙈. That’s what makes me fall for you, over and over again 💋♾️.
